# React Rendering

## Objectives

1. Explain what happens when React renders a component
2. Explain why `render()` must be idempotent
3. Describe the parts of the component lifecycle leading up to and coming after
   `render()`

The Circle of Life. Who knew learning about the React framework could bring us
to the Lion King? As with every creature in the animal kingdom, React components
get created and destroyed only once. The majority of their lifetime is spent on
updating - that is, reacting to user interactions.

We are kindly provided with 4 lifecycle methods to help us handle
updates:`static getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate`,
`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate`.

These methods always get called in the same order and the `render()` method
which renders the React component into the DOM will be called just before
`componentDidUpdate`, so the actual order of lifecycle methods being called is:

1. `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`

2. `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`

4. `render()` (can access props and state via `this.props` and `this.state` -
previous props are no longer available)

5. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`

6. `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)` (can still access
current props and state via `this.props` and `this.state` and this is the last
time previous props and state will be available).

#### `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`

This method is called on _every_ update. That means whenever the component is
receiving new props from it's parent or a the component state has changed. A
word of caution: a common mistake here is to assume that the props have changed.
Just because the method is called doesn't necessarily mean that the props have
changed. It is entirely possible that a parent component has updated and in
re-rendering has passed the _same_ props down to its children. In this case,
regular components will still be triggered to update.

This method is for deriving state, meaning you want to modify a components state
based on something in the new props. React's [official advice][derived] is that
you probably don't need this, and in many cases where it seems necessary, there
is often a better solution.

#### `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`

The `shouldComponentUpdate` method is the odd one out in the lifecycle methods
as it doesn't operate on the state, but has a `Boolean` return value determining
whether the component should update or not. It's sole use is for custom
performance optimization.

Say, for instance, you only want a component to update when a value changes
past a set threshold, you could use this method to prevent component updating
_until_ the props meet the requirement.

For general optimization of updating, React recommends an alternative - use
`React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component`. From the [React reference
materials][pure]:

> "If your React componentâ€™s render() function renders the same result given the
same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent for a performance boost in
some cases."

The `PureComponent` does not have access to `shouldComponentUpdate`, because it
instead runs its own version. The `PureComponent` checks to see if there are any
_shallow_ changes to props and state and will only update if it registers a
difference between the current and next states.

When your applications start to get really big, using `PureComponent` is useful
for stopping un-necessary re-renders and making your website faster.

When you really want to customize the logic for when to re-render, use
`shouldComponentUpdate`.

```javascript
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return (this.props.myImportantValue !== nextProps.myImportantValue);
}
```

#### `render()`

The `render()` method is the most familiar one to all React developers. In fact,
in everyday development, we often end up writing React components that only use
the `render()` method! At this stage, the next props and state have become
available as `this.props` and `this.state` and the component gets rendered
into React's virtual DOM.

In a theater, this is when a specific scene in a play is being carried out: no
changes are being made to the script or the scenery at this stage, it is purely
taking the script the director is happy with and the props that have been laid
out, and carrying out the play.

#### `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`

Right after render, but _just before_ React commits content from its virtual DOM
to the actual DOM, the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` method is fired.
This method is currently only used to capture information that may be changed
after an update. For instance, mouse position and scroll position might be
changing rapidly and will change by the time the next lifecycle method is
invoked. This method returns either `null` or a value that will be passed into
the next method, `componentDidUpdate`.

#### `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`

This method isn't used very often, but it is kind of a look back to the update
that just occurred. We will have access to both the current props and previous
props, as well as any snapshot info from `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`. A common use
case for this would be to update a 3rd party library.

```javascript
  componentDidUpdate(previousProps, previousState) {
   if (previousProps.height !== this.props.height) {
     someChartLibrary.updateHeight(this.props.height);
   }
  }
```

This method can also be used to interact with the DOM, say be adjusting scroll
position.

## Summary

These are all the tools we get to help us decide how to react to changes in our
component. The `render()` method is the only one we *must* have - everything
else is optional. Use these methods sparingly. In the ideal world, we want to
have as little of these methods as possible.

#### Updating lifecycle methods

Not called on initial render, but always called whenever a subsequent re-render is triggered:

| Method            | current props and state | previousProps | previousState | nextProps |  nextState | Can call `this.setState` | Called when?               | Used for                                                                                    |
|:-------------------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------------:|
| `static getDerivedStateFromProps()` |    yes    |     no    |     no    |     no    |     no    |     yes     |     before every render  |   Not used often |
|   `shouldComponentUpdate`   |    yes    |    no    |    no    |    yes    |    yes   |    yes    | before every re-render (not initially) | can be used to stop unnecessary re-renders for performance optimization |
|     `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`    |    yes   |    yes   |    yes   |    no   |    no   |    yes   | just before React updates and commits new content to the DOM | used rarely; can capture data that may be changing rapidly |
|     `componentDidUpdate`    |    yes   |    yes    |    yes    |    no   |    no    |    yes    | just after a re-render has finished | any DOM updates following a render (mostly interacting with 3rd party libraries) |

`componentDidUpdate` will actually receive the previous props and state as arguments, as the newly applied state and props can be accessed through `this.props` and `this.state`.
